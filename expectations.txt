My expectations in CMSC 100 is that it will be difficult based on my classmates' expectations earlier in class. With all the negative experiences that my classmates or their upper classmen had, I feel like my experience with this class would somehow mirror what they experienced. At first, I felt excited taking this web devolopment class. Now i feel more anxious than excited. However I still am hoping for a far better outcome.
